May the spirit of Linux and GNU and all supporting peoble be with you...
No liability for any damage and/or loss of data or whatsoever caused by the
use of this distribution. Its all at your own risk.

This small HOWTO file was compiled from:
Peter Sieg		
Rabishauerstr.9
D-37603 Holzminden
GERMANY
Please, if you try Xlinux send me a postcard with a small comment...
Also bug fixes are highly welcome.

Source code is available from sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux, tsx-11.mit.edu and
various CD-ROM's.

Mini Linux will not work with DBLSPACE. Uncompress your drive first.

There are two howto files in the /Library directory:
hardware.howto	(english)	explains hardware related questions.
german.howto	(german)	explains german user questions.

To install this distribution:
Space required during installation app. 68 MB.
Space required after installation app. 48 MB.
Since Version V951101, all disk except the last one are higher formatted
with the 2m tools (1,8 MB). To access the disk, you must insert the last
disk first and do a a:\2m.com to install the driver. This driver can also
read and write all other formats transparantly...
x:  (where x is your destination drive to install to)  
md \tmp  (if not already exist)
cd \tmp
Now for all disk:
copy a:\*.*
unrar x xlinux 
del xlinux.r??
Now you can start linux with linux.bat <x>!!!

ATTENTION:
Now you can easily setup your keyboard layout, mouse, modem, timezone,
cdrom, swapspace and network by running the setup script in /sbin. 
This script as the related *conf* scripts are adapted from the Slackware 
distribution.
See the copyright notice in setup. - Many thanks to Patrick Volkerding!

It will load the portugese keymap. To change to us:
temporarily execute:
/usr/bin/loadkeys /usr/lib/kbd/keytables/us.map
('/' key is '" key...)
than change file /etc/rc.d/rc.keymap...
I did that already...
I also added de.map (German) and es.map (Spanish) to the directory...
X uses a file called .Xmodmap under dir:
/usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/
If nothing is there it uses us layout.
I copied xmodmap.gr, *.uk etc in that dir. Please just rename if needed.

/dev/modem is linked to /dev/cua1 which is for dos users com2.
to change for example to com1 do:
rm /dev/modem; ln -s /dev/cua0 /dev/modem

/dev/mouse is linked to /dev/ttyS0 which is for dos users com1.
to change to com2 etc. do:
rm /dev/mouse; ln -s /dev/ttyS1 /dev/mouse

X Version is X11R5!!
Xwindows: my mouse did not work. caused by selection program started in
/etc/rc.d/rc.local
just comment the lines out and restart.
Xwindows needs at least 8MB of memory. If you have less you should use
a swapfile:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count =4096 # or 8192...
mkswap /swapfile 4096
sync
swapon /swapfile
# Only the last command have to be repeated each time you boot!!
# or put the folowing line in /etc/fstab:
/swapfile	none	swap	defaults
# or use the script swap <size_in_bytes> in /usr/bin...
# if you dont specify the sizes, just swapon /swapfile will be executed!

This packages/programs i would like to include in this distribution:
PCMCIA support thru loadable kernel modules.
Newer WINE binary.

If you like to install other packages, i did it the following way:
# Because the cdrom on my computer did not work at the time...
I selected the appropriate packages <*.tgz> and copied them with the 
windows filemanager from a cdrom to disk a:
Then i started linux:
With cd /tmp i go into the tmp directory.
With mcopy a:<package.tgz> <package.tgz> i copied the file(s) into
the current directory.
With tar -zxvf <package.tgz> i uncompressed and untared them.
Now you will see several directories and files in the /tmp directory.
Try the executables and if you want to keep them move all neccessary
files to their directories ex: /tmp/usr/bin/ash -> /usr/bin/ash.

For working with dos floppy disk to can use the mtools:
ex: mdir a: - directory of drive a:
    mread -t a:howto howto - read file howto from a: to current directory
    mwrite -t howto a: - write file howto to drive a:
(-t switch translates <lf> to <cr><lf> and vice versa...)

For DOS users i made a link from del to rm and from copy to cp.
That means you can use del to delete files and copy to copy them.
Also md is linked to mkdir and rd to rmdir.

You can print ascii files with following command:
p <filename> ;this is just a script under /usr/bin that inserts a <cr> at
the end of each line and then calls lpr.
This is the script p:
#!/bin/sh
cat $1 | sed -e s/$/^M/ | lpr
# ^M is CTRL-M; Use CTRL-V, CTRL-M in vi.
There is also a small script called pap under /usr/bin to allow printing
of attributes like bold and underline. In your text include:
.B for bold on
.b for bold off
.U for underline on
.u for underline off
The script simply replaces this strings with the appropriate control codes.
Currently the codes are set for HP Laserjet PCL and testet with HP Laserjet 4L.
Under /root is a small print.test file. Try pap print.test.

You get help on commands by run <cmd> --help or -?.

Try working with scripts together with the dialog program, see ex.
under /var/adm/scripts.

There is a nice monitor program. run top.

If you know Norton Commander run mc.

Try the game sasteroids.
For the game lr, please cd /usr/games first...
The file svgalib.config is in /usr/local/lib!

Workbone is nice audio cdrom player.

There are some setup scripts in /var/adm/scripts/
I used one to setup my cdrom (mitsumi).

If you want to work on 2 sessions on one screen try splitvt.
    
To see if your mouse works, try test-mouse.

To check if Xwindows would run try X -probeonly.
If the message says, dot clock not found, update the lowes available
dot clock reported by X -probeonly in file Xconfig at mode "640x480"!
and the "800x600" mode as well! That should as least bring you up in X.
In Xwindows you can abort with CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE.
The first time you should start with startx 2>startx.log.
All messages from x will be logged in startx.log.
I you like a nice background picture in your X desktop try:
# xv -root -max -quit </usr/lib/pictures/picture_filename> &
