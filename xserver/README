		  XFree86 2.0 Release for Linux (31 Oct 93)
		  =========================================

Checklist:
==========
   This is a quick checklist for the impatient, the issues are explained in
this document.

  ( ) XFree86 2.0 requires ld.so 1.3 or greater
  ( ) XFree86 2.0 requires libc 4.4.1 or greater
  ( ) XFree86 2.0 requires kernel greater/equal to 0.99pl12 for SVGA server
      (ld.so requires this)
  ( ) XFree86 2.0 requires kernel greater/equal to 0.99pl13 for some
       accelerated servers
  ( ) You need 3.5-3.7MB of disk space for a minimal installation, depending
       on the Xserver you use.
  ( ) You must be root and use a `umask 022' for the install
  ( ) Untar files from /

Requirements:
=============
   XFree86 2.0 has dynamically linked libraries that use `ld.so'.  You need to
have installed at least version 1.3 of ld.so.  If you are already
using the ld.so dynamic linker you can find out the current version by typing
the command `ldd -V'.  The ld.so dynamic linker will not prevent old (non
ld.so) binaries from working, after it has been installed any new files you
compile will use it (they will also be 2.5K smaller in size).  XFree86 2.0
does *not* include ld.so - you will need to obtain it.

   You need to be using a version of libc greater than 4.4.1 (sometimes it is
written as `DLL Jump 4.4pl1')

   If you are using the SVGA and Mono servers you need to be using a kernel
that is greater than or equal to 0.99pl12 (ld.so requires this).  The
accelerated servers require a kernel greater than or equal to 0.99pl13 because
they use the mmap() system call (the implementation in earlier kernels does
not work correctly).

   3.5-3.7MB of disk space is required for a minimal installation (depends on
the Xserver you use).

   If you choose to install *all* of XFree86 2.0 you will need 21MB of disk
space.  You will need approxmately 10MB more space if you wish to rebuild all
the servers.  You will need 2.5MB to rebuild a single server with PEX.

   It is recomended that your system have at least 8MB of main memory to
comfortably use XFree86 2.0.  

Shadow Passwords:
=================

   The binary release of XFree86 2.0 for Linux has a shell script that starts
either xdm-shadow or xdm-passwd depending on the existance of the /etc/shadow
file.  If you wish to save disk space you can remove the xdm shell script,
rename the appropriate xdm binary and remove the other.

   The Linux binaries released by the XFree86 team have the following `gzip'
crc values as reported by `gzip --list --verbose'.  If the files you retreive
do not have these crc values then this document does not describe what is in
your files.  Proceed with caution.

Installation:
=============
   The contents of the above files should be extracted from the / directory on
your system as the user `root'.  Before doing this you should check that your
`umask' value is 022.  To be sure use the command `umask 022'.  Caution: If
you do not extract the files as user `root' with the correct umask you may not
be able to run XFree86 2.0.  Some of the files need special permissions that
can only be assigned by this user.

   Base Configuration: (3.5-3.7MB Depends on Xserver chosen)
   -------------------
      As hinted in the requirements section, you do not need to install all of
   the pieces of XFree86 2.0 to be able to use it.  A minimal configuration
   needs 3.5-3.7MB of free disk space and the following three files:

   xf86-bin-2.0.tar.gz    Client programs
   xf86-lib-2.0.tar.gz    Dynamic libraries, config files and minimal fonts
   XF86_<XXX>.tar.gz      An Xserver for your card.

      You are warned that some of the client programs may complain and not run
   because of missing fonts.

   Option: (+2.1MB) full fonts
   -------
      The fonts file contains all the 75dpi fonts (excluding PEX) that are
   released with X11 Release 5.
    
   xf86-fnt-2.0.tar.gz    Fonts (all of them)

   Option: (+2.8MB) building X11 software - programmers kit
   -------
      In order to build additional X11 software you will need the following
   files in addition to the minimal configuration,

   xf86-prg-2.0.tar.gz    Static libs, dynamic stubs, configs and includes

   Option: (+2.6MB) manual pages
   -------
      This file contains manual pages for XFree86 2.0 servers and utilities
   plus X11 clients and programming libraries.

   xf86-man-2.0.tar.gz    Manual pages (both client + programmer)

   Option: accelerated servers
   -------
      If you have a graphics board that has one of the supported accelerated
   chipsets using one of these accelerated servers.

   XF86_8514-2.0.tar.gz   An accelerated server for cards using IBM8514 chips
   XF86_Mach32-2.0.tar.gz An accelerated server for cards using Mach32 chips
   XF86_Mach8-2.0.tar.gz  An accelerated server for cards using Mach8 chips
   XF86_S3-2.0.tar.gz     An accelerated server for cards using S3 chips
 
   NOTE: There is some simple accelerated support for cards using the Cirrus
   Logic 5426/5428 and Western Digital wd90c31 in the regular XF86_SVGA
   server.  Consult the manual page for Xconfig for how to control the
   accelerated features.

   Option: (+4.8MB) Linkkit (rebuilding an XFree86 2.0 server)
   -------
      If you want or need to rebuild an XFree86 2.0 server you need the
   following file in addition to the base configuration and the programmers
   kit.

   xf86-kit-2.0.tar.gz    Linkkit for building your own X servers

      When rebuilding all the servers (including PEX) you will typically need
   an additional 10MB of disk space.  If you are building just a single server
   you will need 2MB (2.5MB with PEX) of space.

   Option: (+2.8MB) PEX libraries
   ------- 
      If you would like to use and build PEX programs you will need the
   following file in addition to a server that supports PEX.  The distributed
   servers do *not* include PEX support by default - you will have to build
   one using the link kit.

   xf86-pex-2.0.tar.gz    PEX libraries and sample clients

   Option: (+30k) XDM configuration files
   -------
      If you are using XDM you may want these cofiguration files and chooser.

   xf86-cfg-2.0.tar.gz    XDM configuration files and chooser
